# California Community Colleges Salary Study

* Salary data courtesy Joanna Valentine at CFT.

* Home loan qualification based the [National Association of Realtors's qualifying income formula](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics/housing-affordability-index/methodology), with home values pulled from the [Zillow Home Value index](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) (currently for April 2018).

* PT/FT pro rata is computed using 100% of both full-time and part-time rates, even though this includes pay for office hours in the case of full-time faculty and some part-time faculty, which results in undervaluing part-time rates in districts that provide extra pay for office hours.

* Median home price and radius is calculated as follows: All ZIP codes with centroids no further than the stated radius from the centroid of any ZIP code in the district are included in the calculuations. The price used here is the average of the Zillow Home Value index in those ZIP codes.
